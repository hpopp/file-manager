# File Manager

A unified internal API for file storage and CMS-like file management.

## Project Dependencies

- Rust 1.93+
- Docker (optional, for clustered deployment)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/hpopp/file-manager && cd file-manager
```

2. Build the project.

```shell
cargo build --release
```

3. Run the service.

```shell
cargo run --release
```

The service starts on `http://localhost:8080` with sensible defaults. No external database required.

## Contributing

### Testing

Unit and integration tests can be run with `cargo test`.

### Formatting

This project uses `cargo fmt` for formatting.

## Deployment

Deployments require the following environment variables to be set in containers:

| Key                       | Description                                           | Default        |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| `BIND_ADDRESS`            | HTTP server bind address.                             | `0.0.0.0:8080` |
| `CLUSTER_PORT`            | TCP port for inter-node cluster communication.        | `9993`         |
| `DATA_DIR`                | Data directory for embedded database.                 | `./data`       |
| `DISCOVERY_DNS_NAME`      | DNS name for peer discovery. Enables DNS strategy.    |                |
| `DISCOVERY_POLL_INTERVAL` | Discovery poll interval in seconds.                   | `5`            |
| `GCS_BUCKET`              | GCS bucket name. Required when `STORAGE_BACKEND=gcs`. |                |
| `GCS_CREDENTIALS_FILE`    | Path to GCS service account JSON.                     |                |
| `LOCAL_STORAGE_PATH`      | Directory for local file storage.                     | `./files`      |
| `LOG_FORMAT`              | Log output format: `gcp`, `json`, or `text`.          | `text`         |
| `MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE`         | Maximum upload size in bytes.                         | `52428800`     |
| `NODE_ID`                 | Unique node identifier.                               | Random UUID    |
| `PEERS`                   | Comma-separated static peer addresses.                |                |
| `RUST_LOG`                | Log level filter.                                     | `info`         |
| `STORAGE_BACKEND`         | Object storage backend: `local` or `gcs`.             | `local`        |
| `TEST_MODE`               | Enables dangerous operations like purge.              | `false`        |

### Liveness

A health check endpoint is available at `/_internal/health`.

### Clustering

For multi-node deployments, set `DISCOVERY_DNS_NAME` to a DNS name that resolves to all
node IPs. This works with Docker Compose service names and Kubernetes headless Services. Alternatively,
use `PEERS` for a static peer list.

The included `docker-compose.yml` runs a 3-node cluster with DNS-based discovery.
